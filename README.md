CodeReview #11

Key Comments:

Overall status and comments on the Code Review 11:
- Points 1 - 5 seem to be well achieved. 

- Point 6: Create Registration and Login System.
	--> Overall Registration form is fully functioning and new users have their data showing up in the DB.
	--> Login page is created but is not functioning. 

- Point 8: Admin panel is fully functioning and able to create data, edit data and delete data. This page is found on the adminpanel.php. As it's not directly accessible from the other pages as it is an admin panel. This flows with sessions in the end.

- Point 7: Overall session data and sessions are not funtioning, all code is commented out but is left there for further review. It just is not working on the login and then being able to access the pages. 

Otherwise:

a. Start and registration page is index.php.

b. Folder: DatabaseDevelopment are all pdf's for the db creation phase till 3NF.

c. Folder: DatabaseDump is where the database sql file can be found. 


Thanks,
